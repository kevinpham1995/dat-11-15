I don't know where I went wrong, but I cannot get my model to actually operate after exporting it with pickle.  Both inside and outside streamlit, I get the same error and spent hours trying to diagnose it.  The model seemed to work according to the graphs, but changing the most impactful factor (OverallQual) had no effect on the prediction.  Nothing changed the prediction.  I included the jupyter notebook I used to export the model via pickle if it offers any explanation to where I went wrong.
